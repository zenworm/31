Oh where do I even start with this one. How about a confession: Joss Whedon has never written or directed anything that I've found enjoyable (except when he helped out on the Toy Story script and added Rex… possibly his greatest achievement?). I think he is, at best, a mediocre filmmaker who refuses to — or can't — dig very deep into stories or characters, always staying near the surface where it's safe and easy. *The Cabin in the Woods* is more of the same. Even though it was directed by long-time Whedon collaborator Drew Goddard, it has Whedon's stink all over it.

The first half is a cross between *The Evil Dead* and *The Truman Show* as we travel with a group of college students to a remote cabin for a weekend of terror-fun. At the same time we're watching them via audio and video surveillance back at a base of operations. We don't know exactly what sort of operation it is until later in the film, all we can gather is that the group is going to be — to quote my wife — "seriously fucked with."

Indeed they are. The one positive thing I can say about this movie is that's a one big metaphor for how we consume and ultimately require entertainment in a cyclical frenzy. This is a rumination on a lack of taste by the masses and how we indirectly create crap by desiring crap. Whedon is, in a way, giving a big middle finger to audience expectations and desires. But the film falls into its own trap when you discover what's really going on. As a metaphor, it's ultimately trite and boring.

I know plenty of people loved this movie and will think I'm crazy for hating it. I just feel that as an action/horror/comedy it's unoriginal and poorly written, and as a thematic statement it's shallow and forgettable.

Fear. No, not the fear of things that go bump in the night or of the creepy stalker dude that keeps eyeing you through his clumps of overgrown hair. Not the fear of spiders or snakes or heights or clowns. No... fear of pissing people off. It's something that most of us are afraid of, but Lars von Trier simply doesn't give a shit.

*Antichrist* opens with one of the most horrific and pornographic (the director hired porn actors for the hardcore stuff) and disturbing and awesome scenes ever to grace the theater screen or your television. It's at this point you have absolutely no doubt that you're in a Lars von Trier experience and that you probably won't sleep well afterwards.

Willem Defoe plays He, a therapist. Charlotte Gainsbourg plays She, a mother who is seriously fucked up after losing her child. Except von Trier begs the sorts of questions that stay with you after you've left your cozy multiplex: is She fucked up, or He, or me?

I won't go into details of the plot, and if you watch it you'll thank me later. But be warned, especially if you've never watched a von Trier film: this movie will offend you, make you laugh, make you cry, and make you realize that human beings can &mdash; even back in the real world &mdash; be seriously...

...wait for it... 

**fucked up**.
